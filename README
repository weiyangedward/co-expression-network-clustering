'Clustering_noise_cluster_slow': contains src code and test case for implementation and clustering model with noise cluster. 

'InOutRatioModel_with_Noise_Cluster_fast': contains src code and test case for clustering. Note that this is a fast implementation of the same model in 'Clustering_noise_cluster_slow'. Codes are tested and consistent results are obtained between this two implementations.

'evaluate_clustering': contains scripts to evaluate clustering results.
