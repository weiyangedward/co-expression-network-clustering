This dir contains src code and test data for clustering with noise cluster. Please note that this is a slow implementation of clustering model.

Model for clustering:
	1) Cost function for one species:
		C = - (sum_over_i(in_cluster_density(i) / ( in_cluster_density(i) + out_cluster_density(i))) * n + lamda * noise_term)
		where
		N: #total genes in network
		n: size(i)
		i: cluster i
		in_cluster_density(i): in_cluster_edges / (n * (n-1) / 2)
		out_cluster_density(i): out_cluster_edges / ((N-n) * n)
		noise_term: #genes in noise cluster
		lamda: sum_over_i(in_cluster_density(i) / ( in_cluster_density(i) + out_cluster_density(i))) / N
	2) There will be k+1 clusters in the output clustering, where cluster0 is noise cluster and k is the number of clusters specified in arguments
	3) ortholog term: a ortholog term is finally added to the cost function. This term is #ortholog edges where both end nodes of it are in the same cluster. A noise term for ortholog term is also added. Noise term = alpha * #genes in noise cluster, where alpha = sum(#ortholog edges) / N

To compile:
>> cd src
>> g++ -O3 -o bin/clustering -Wno-deprecated -std=c++0x *.cpp

To test code on test data:
>> ./src/bin/clustering
>> ./src/bin/clustering 10 1 1 test_data/orth.txt 3 test_data/network0.txt test_data/network1.txt test_data/network2.txt -t 1 2>log >out

Tips:
	1) To get results sooner, try smaller -t
	2) To get clusters with higher in/out denstiy ratio, try smaller -couplingConstant
	3) To get smaller cost, try larger -t
